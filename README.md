# MultiAgentSystem-Irrigation-BDI

This is an ongoing project of Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) that is currently being developed to understand cooperation among farmers and allocation mechanisms related to irrigation in the Urubu river basin, a sub-basin of the Brazilian Formoso river basin.

GAMA platform is used with GAML language.

To run the model:
- Download GAMA 1.8.2-RC1: https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/releases/tag/1.8.2-RC1
- Import (https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/ImportingModels) the model 'UrubuRiverModel.gaml' and the includes.
